My name is Catarina Soeiro (she/her) and I am an aspiring Japanese to English, Japanese to Portuguese translator. I am particularly interested in video game translation and localization. Additionally, I am also interested in working in LGBT+ projects, including Yuri/Shoujo-ai manga and anime. (I'm also open to R18+ projects!)

Previously, I have worked at a medium-sized Portuguese company, where amongst other responsibilities, I was in charge of translations of all documentations produced and received, as well as interpreting during internation business meetings, in the following language pairs: English <-> Portuguese, French <-> Portuguese and Spanish <-> Portuguese.

Currently, I am working full time as a private tutor, working with kids from all ages, ranging from 6 to 18 years old. I teach Portuguese, English and French. Working with young people has been very rewarding and a humbling experience in patience, organization and my own language skills. It has forced me to engage with language and language learning from another perspective, that of a teacher.

As of March 2021, I am self-studying Japanese and working towards earning the JLPT N2 certification. **I am looking for opportunities as a translator/localizer, proofreading or editing in the following language pairs: English <-> Portuguese, Portuguese <-> English, Spanish <-> Portuguese, French <-> Portuguese**
