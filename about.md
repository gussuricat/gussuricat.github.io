My name is Catarina Soeiro (she/her) and I am an aspiring Japanese to English, Japanese to Portuguese translator. I am particularly interested in video game translation and localization. Additionally, I am also interested in working in LGBT+ projects, including Yuri/Shoujo-ai manga and anime. (I'm also open to R18+ projects!)

Previously, I have worked at a medium-sized Portuguese company, where amongst other responsibilities, **I was in charge of translations of all documentations produced and received, as well as interpreting during internation business meetings**, in the following language pairs: English <-> Portuguese, French <-> Portuguese and Spanish <-> Portuguese.

Currently, I am working full time as a private tutor, working with kids from all ages, ranging from 6 to 18 years old. I work with them on their language skills, mainly in Portuguese, English and French. Working with young people has been very rewarding and an experience in patience, organization and leadership as well as a push to my language skills, having to constantly learn their intricacies, so I can teach them and, most importantly, get my students to comprehend them.

As of March 2021, I am self-studying Japanese and working towards taking the JLPT N2 certification. **I am looking for opportunities as a translator/localizer, proofreading or editing in the following language pairs: English <-> Portuguese.**
